      <p>My name is Alexander Price. I am just starting out learning to program,
      but it is my eventual goal to become a video game developer.

      Ever since I was a small child I have been captivated by the way game makers are able
      to create expansive and exciting worlds,
      using nothing but a computer and a little know-how.

      As I have grown older I have realised there is much more to game devlopment
      than I could ever Imagine. I have since started on my journey down the programmers path.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="col2">
      <p>I am presently taking classes for web development, as well as Java, database, and game design.
      My intent is to expand my computer knowledge until I can create worlds of my very own.
      My programing experience is growing, but I still have a long way to go.
